- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE (3 forms, see: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/delete.html)
- TRANSACTIONS
- Support for other SQL Statements.  What percentage of keywords
  are covered?
- SELECT:
    - Joins
    - GROUP BY
    - LIMIT with offset
    - mysql procedures (for GROUP BY)
    - mysql modifiers  (i.e. DISTINCT)
- Write all database access to a log


- Integration with rails
  - Intercept/Override Mysql Adapter:
    - SELECT => #select
    - model declarations (to add to ActiveRecord::Base)
- Security: simple key value pairs of username, password,
  with all access to data.  Can we encrypt this over SSL
  (or another secure protocol) to get to the DRB process?

- Is there a way to see the memory size of an object in Ruby?
  It sure would be nice to be able to limit how big in RAM these
  objects will get, i.e.:
  
  class MyClass < ActiveRecord::Base
    cache_model :limit_memory => 100.megabytes
  end

- Efficiency issues: Indexes ?
- Joins
- should we give a dup of hashes out of the cache?  Does AR modify 
  the values inside the hash of #select?
- Treetop doesn't support case insensitive matching.  Need to provide
  a patch for this
- errors in sql parsing 
  - SQLNotUnderstood (a parsing error)
  - NotImplementedErrors (for selects which aren't implemented)
- DRb, so that multiple mongrels can all talk to the same cache
- Threading for the drb/data access
- Database formats.  Is one big array per table really a good format?
  - Should Set be used instead of Array?
- Other database adapters?  SQLite?  Decouple design
- Option to disconnect from database entirely in tests.
  - if NotImplementedError, then we *should* use the real database!
- Could we make this lazy, as opposed to eager?
  - seems that we could, if we could figure out that certain queries
    are subsets of other queries.  For instance:
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name = "scott"
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name = "scott" AND first_name = "Scott"
   Or, that queries could be combined:
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name = "Scott"
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = "Taylor"
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE first_name = "Scott" AND last_name = "Taylor"
